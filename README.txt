Added methods to import tilemaps from a bmp. To do this I've created a small app that reads a text file and exports data to the blue channel of an image
	All tilemaps are found in the resources/tilemaps folder. bmp files are used by the app. txt files are just for readability.
Added a new tileset
Added "motivational" messages when you get back to the beginning of the dungeon
Added an additional layer with objects in some rooms
Add an enemy that fires bullets in the last room

How to play:
	Move with the up/down/right/left arrows
	Press P to pause
