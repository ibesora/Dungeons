Added methods to import tilemaps from a bmp. To do this I've created a small app that reads a text file and exports data to the blue channel of an image
	All tilemaps are found in the resources/tilemaps folder. bmp files are used by the app. txt files are just for readability.
Added a new tileset
Added "motivational" messages when you get back to the beginning of the dungeon
Added an additional layer with objects in some rooms
* Add bullets
